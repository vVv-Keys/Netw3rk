I am currently working on getting a PyCharm License to continue this Development. 

This project entitles the use of a CyberSecurity Suite/Teaching system along with much more to Discord Users.

I will begin to incorporate the Main.PY once I get some more confirmation from JetBrain if I can get a License to proceed with this project.

## Some features currently working on incorporating or incorporated already:

```
Real-time Threat Intelligence Integration: Integrate with threat intelligence feeds to identify known malicious IPs, domains, and URLs.

Dynamic Whitelisting: Implement dynamic whitelisting of trusted IPs, domains, and users to reduce false positives.

Advanced Anomaly Detection: Enhance anomaly detection algorithms with machine learning techniques for more accurate threat detection.

File Hash Checking: Add the ability to check the integrity of files by comparing their hashes with known good hashes.

Vulnerability Scanning: Incorporate vulnerability scanning tools to identify weaknesses in target systems.

Incident Reporting: Implement a reporting mechanism for users to report suspicious activity or incidents directly to administrators.

User Behavior Analytics: Analyze user behavior to detect anomalies in login patterns and access to sensitive resources.

Network Traffic Analysis: Perform in-depth analysis of network traffic to identify patterns indicative of attacks.

Notification System: Develop a notification system to alert administrators and users about security events in real-time.

Phishing Detection: Use machine learning models to detect phishing attempts in messages and links.

Web Application Firewall (WAF): Integrate a WAF to protect web applications from common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Implement a SIEM system for centralized log management and correlation of security events.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Provide MFA options to enhance user account security.

Password Policy Enforcement: Enforce strong password policies and notify users when their passwords are weak or compromised.

Device Fingerprinting: Implement device fingerprinting to detect and block access from unrecognized or suspicious devices.

Threat Intelligence Feeds: Continuously update threat intelligence feeds to stay up-to-date with the latest threats.

Integration with Security Tools: Integrate with popular security tools like antivirus scanners, intrusion detection systems, and firewalls.

Security Training: Offer security awareness training to educate users about best practices and common threats.

Compliance Monitoring: Monitor compliance with security standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and generate compliance reports.

Secure File Uploads: Implement secure file upload mechanisms with malware scanning and validation.

Certificate Monitoring: Check SSL/TLS certificates for expiration and vulnerabilities.

Security Dashboard: Create a dashboard to provide a visual overview of the network's security status.

Security Policies: Define and enforce security policies across the server and network.

Threat Hunting: Actively hunt for threats and vulnerabilities using advanced search and analysis techniques.

Security Score: Calculate and display a security score to quantify the overall security posture.

Security Chatbot: Implement a security-focused chatbot that can answer security-related questions and provide guidance.

Secure API Endpoints: Ensure that API endpoints are secure and protected against attacks like SQL injection and CSRF.

Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using strong encryption methods.

Log Retention and Analysis: Retain logs for an extended period and perform historical analysis for incident investigations.

Red Team Testing: Conduct regular red team exercises to simulate real-world attacks and test the system's defenses.

Comprehensive Documentation: Maintain detailed documentation on security policies, incident response plans, and procedures.

Security Alerts: Provide actionable alerts with recommended responses for each security event.

Forensics Capabilities: Build in forensics capabilities to investigate security incidents thoroughly.

User Access Reviews: Regularly review and audit user access rights to ensure the principle of least privilege.

Backup and Recovery: Implement robust backup and recovery procedures to minimize downtime in case of an attack.

API Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting for API requests to protect against abuse and DDoS attacks.

Security Compliance Checks: Automate security compliance checks to ensure systems adhere to security standards.

User Activity Monitoring: Continuously monitor user activity and flag suspicious behavior.

IP Reputation Filtering: Use IP reputation services to block connections from known malicious IPs.

Dark Web Monitoring: Continuously monitor the dark web for mentions of your organization's data or credentials.

Security Awareness Campaigns: Conduct regular security awareness campaigns to educate users about emerging threats.

Automated Patch Management: Automate the process of applying security patches to the operating system and software.

Third-Party Component Scanning: Scan and monitor third-party components and libraries for vulnerabilities.

Network Segmentation: Implement network segmentation to isolate critical assets from less secure areas.

Cloud Security: Extend security measures to cloud infrastructure and services.

API Security: Securely manage and authenticate API endpoints and ensure proper authorization.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Policy: Enforce strict CORS policies to prevent unauthorized access to resources.

Security Headers: Implement security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, HTTP Strict Transport Security) to enhance web application security.

Security Logs: Implement detailed security logs to record all security-related events for auditing and analysis.

Security Incident Response Plan: Develop a well-defined incident response plan with clear roles and responsibilities.
